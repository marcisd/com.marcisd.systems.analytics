### Decoupled Analytics Event specification

Empower game designers and analysts by allowing them to define and prepare the Analytics Events directly in Unity.

### Analytics Event grammar

Consistency and understandability are qualities of a good Analytics Event report. Enforcing a "grammar" allows for a standardized definition of Analytics Events.

### Analytics Events as executable objects

Once the Analytics Events have been carefully planned and prepared, it is now the responsibility of the developers to supply the proper data and to implement the execution of the Analytics Events.
